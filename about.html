    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      Mel's Bakery opened in Jersey City in 2008, in the wake of the market crash, with a simple goal: bake good food and make sure none of it goes to waste. From the beginning, we committed to sharing leftover baked goods with local organizations to help support people in need.

    <p>
      We operate as a no-waste bakery and partner with local charities to share leftover baked goods with people in need. Every decision we make—from recipes to daily bakes—is guided by the belief that good food should support both people and community.
