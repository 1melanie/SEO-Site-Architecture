# SEO-Site-Architecture
A first-pass SEO site architecture project covering crawlability, indexing readiness, and sitemap generation.
This repository documents my first end-to-end SEO site architecture build, focusing on technical foundations required before ranking or growth efforts.

The goal of this project was to understand and implement Phase 1 SEO: site structure, crawlability, and indexing readiness — independent of content scale or authority building.
What this project covers
-Site architecture planning
-Visual sitemap creation
-Page hierarchy and intent definition
-Core page setup
-Home, About, Menu/Services, and Contact pages
-Each page assigned a specific SEO goal
-Technical crawlability
-Clean project structure
-Valid HTML pages
-One <h1> per page
-Intent-driven page titles and meta descriptions
-Indexing readiness
-Programmatic generation of an XML sitemap
-robots.txt configuration with crawl directives and sitemap reference

This project represents the SEO foundation phase that precedes content expansion, authority building, and ranking optimization.

What this project does not cover (yet)

Backlink building
Content scaling
Ongoing ranking optimization
Analytics or performance tracking

Those steps depend on a solid technical foundation, which is the focus here.
